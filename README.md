# Parallel Crop (title in progress)

This is a little utility for doing simulatanious croppings across aligned images. Start with `python3 crop_hack.py`

By controlling the ROI (the little red thing) in the window on the right, one can set the crop across all the images open in the tabs. To save, use File>Save All and navigate to the dir where you would like them saved and then in the "Save As" box, enter a suffix for the save files. 

**Note:** the filenames of the croppings will be the same as the original images, just with the added suffix.

Here's another edit
